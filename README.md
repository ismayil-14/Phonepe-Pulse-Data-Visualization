# Phonepe-Pulse-Data-Visualization

Overview:

The PhonePe Pulse Dashboard Project is designed to transform complex data into insightful, interactive, and visually appealing visualizations. Our goal is to leverage the extensive data available in the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository to create a user-friendly dashboard that provides valuable insights and information.

We start by efficiently fetching and cloning data from the GitHub repository. Using Python and libraries like Pandas, we clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for analysis and visualization. The cleaned data is then stored in a MySQL database for efficient retrieval and management.

With Streamlit and Plotly, we build an interactive dashboard that showcases the data on a geo map and provides multiple dropdown options for users to explore various facts and figures. The dashboard dynamically fetches data from the MySQL database, ensuring real-time updates.

Our dashboard offers an intuitive interface, making it easy for users to navigate and explore the data. Accessible from any web browser, it provides meaningful insights and information, making it a powerful tool for data analysis and decision-making.


Approach:

Data extraction: Clone the Github using scripting to fetch the data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository and store it in a suitable format such as CSV or JSON.

Data transformation: Use a scripting language such as Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data. This may include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.

Database insertion: Use the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python to connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL commands.

Dashboard creation: Use the Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Plotly's built-in geo map functions can be used to display the data on a map and Streamlit can be used to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display.

Data retrieval: Use the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. Use the data in the dataframe to update the dashboard dynamically.

Deployment: Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Test the solution thoroughly and deploy the dashboard publicly, making it accessible to users. This approach leverages the power of Python and its numerous libraries to extract, transform, and analyze data, and to create a user-friendly dashboard for visualizing the insights obtained from the data.
